## Hi I'm Hanae 👋
## Back End Developer | .NET Framework

I’m a self-taught back-end developer specializing in C#  .NET Framework. My journey into software development  began with curiosity, dedication, and a strong passion for technology.
Over time, I’ve built a solid foundation in back-end development, and I continue to learn every day through hands-on practice, online courses, and personal projects. My goal is to grow into a full-stack web developer, combining my back-end knowledge with modern front-end technologies to build powerful, user-friendly web applications.
